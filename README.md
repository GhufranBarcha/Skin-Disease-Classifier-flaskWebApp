## Project:    
 ## *Skin Disease Detection using Image Processing and Machine Learning*
## Abstract:
Skin illnesses are common and can be caused by a variety of factors including fungi, bacteria, viruses, and allergies. Skin illnesses must be diagnosed early in order to prevent their spread and provide timely treatment. Medical technological innovation, notably in lasers and photonics, has enhanced the accuracy of skin disease diagnosis. However, the expense of such a diagnosis remains exorbitant, keeping it out of reach for many people. To overcome this issue, we present an image processing-based technique combined with machine learning for the early detection of skin disorders. Our method employs a simple and quick technique that requires only a camera and a computer. We intend to classify diseases by extracting features from color photos. This proposal describes the project's approach, dataset, and intended outcomes.

## Introduction:
Skin illnesses are more common than other diseases, and early detection is essential for effective treatment. The suggested study intends to create an automated dermatology screening system using image processing techniques. The device will allow for the rapid and accurate detection of skin disorders, potentially decreasing the strain on healthcare systems and improving patient outcomes. Machine learning algorithms will improve illness classification accuracy and improve medical efficiency in areas where skin disorders are widespread due to hot weather and desert environments.

## Objectives:
    a. To create a Machine Learning model for the early diagnosis of skin disorders.
    b. Using a convolutional neural network to extract information from color images.
    c.To train our model on multiple images.
    d. To assess the model's effectiveness and accuracy in detecting various skin disorders.
